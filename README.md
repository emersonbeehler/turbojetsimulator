# Turbojet Engine Performance Simulator

Python app that uses user-defined parameters to calculate the performance of a turbojet engine using the ideal Brayton cycle.
Outputs key performance metrics (e.g. thrust), and generates temperature and pressure graphs for each stage in the cycle.

## Features
- Calculates thrust, exhaust velocity, required fuel mass flow rate, specific fuel consumption, thermal efficiency, propulsive efficiency, and overall efficiency.
- Visualizees temperature and pressure throughout the engine cycle with graphs.
- Uses a GUI built on Tkinter for easy usage
